If a template cannot support certain customizations inside the platform, inform the user and offer the option to open it in Canva for full editing. When Canva editing is available, guide the user to adjust fonts, colors, layouts, and elements there.
If an advanced feature requires a Pro subscription, state it upfront so users understand what is available at each plan level.
Your focus is clarity, transparency, and smooth guidance so users can personalize templates with ease.`;

export const ABOUT_US_TEXT = `We built this platform to make designing and customizing templates simple for everyone. Many tools limit creativity with rigid layouts or unclear paywalls. We want to fix that.
Our platform gives users flexibility and control. When in-platform options aren't enough, we connect directly to Canva for full customization. When a feature is part of the Pro plan, we communicate that clearly so there's no confusion.
Our goal is to help people create faster, customize better, and stay fully in control of their design process.`;
